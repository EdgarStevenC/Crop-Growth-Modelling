**Mechanistic crop models (MCMs)** are multidisciplinary tools that integrate expertise in dynamic systems modeling, computational techniques, and plant biology. They capture both the internal mechanisms driving plant growth and the external interactions of these mechanisms within dynamic cropping systems [1][2].
The goal of MCM is to simulate plant growth as the product of a series of interactions among the plant and environment. The model functions as an integrated system of reduced algorithms, each describing a different interaction and cohesively linking all model components [1]. Notable and widely-used crop growth models include DSSAT (USA), APSIM (Australia), STICS (France), and AquaCrop (Italy) [3].
