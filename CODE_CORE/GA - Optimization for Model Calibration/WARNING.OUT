 SOILDYN  YEAR DOY = 2012 153
 Soil photosynthesis factor (SLPF) = 0.60                                      

 IPWTH   YEAR DOY = 2012 153
 Value of TAV, average annual soil temperature, is missing.                    
 A default value of 20.0Â°C is being used for this simulation,                 
 which may produce inaccurate results.                                         

 TILLAGE  YEAR DOY = 2012 153
 User-specified tillage depth greater than that specified by tillage implement.
 Tillage operation date: 2012 184
